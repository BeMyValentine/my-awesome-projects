This is one of my first projects. It is very simple, and focused mostly on the javascript and connecting the javascript with the html and css pages. The javascript was tough when I made this, because even getting a functioning button to work was an enormous task, and they wanted us to make multiple buttons that achieved multiple things. After hours of work, I finally came up with the way that I wanted to go about creating my javascript. I put it together, and failed miserably. After a lot of debugging, I finally got the project to work the way that I wanted it to. It was a lot of fun to work on this project, and I truly enjoyed all the puzzles that were involved in making this billing website for Mario.
