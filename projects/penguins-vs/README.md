Penguins vs. Communists is a project that I am very proud of. I accomplished a full-scale war using only vanilla javascript, and the outcome of the war is completely random based on a random number generator that I came up with. The amount of casualties with each nuke is random, and the winner is selected completely at random. It is turn-based, so the Penguins and Communists take turns attacking each other. It was a lot of fun to make, and I really enjoyed this project.
