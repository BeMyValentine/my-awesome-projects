This project was not easy for me to accomplish. I still need to go through it and get rid of some of the bugs that was in my code. I enjoyed working on this rpg a lot though and I believe that it taught me a lot about making sure that my code is organized, and easy to read. Especially when it is only on a single page. When I started this project, I threw things in the next line, but as time went on I started to realize that there needs to be a certain order to things, or debugging the code becomes a nightmare. This project also taught me the value of testing my code as I went, and taught me to make sure that each function is doing what I need it to do before throwing it into all my other functions.
