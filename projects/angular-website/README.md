This project is my first attempt at a fully functioning angular website. It is a simple weather application that shows you the current weather. It pulls your location from your computer, and tells you the weather where you currently are, and updates every 10 seconds. The weekly weather is pulled from the same API, but there is no need to update the weekly weather at all, so I don't have an update function in there. My hourly weather shows the weather in your area every 2 hours for a 12 hour period.
